# Derivative Pricing and Computational Finance Methods

This repository contains various projects and implementations related to derivative pricing and computational methods. Each folder contains code and documentation for different techniques and models used in the field of quantitative finance.

**Note:** This repository is currently a work in progress, and I am still in the process of uploading and organizing the projects. Please check back regularly for updates.

## Folder Structure

- [**American_Options_Binomial_Tree**](./American_Options_Binomial_Tree): 
  - Implementations of the binomial tree model for pricing American options.
  - Includes examples and explanations of the binomial tree approach.

- [**Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_Variance_Estimation**](./Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_Variance_Estimation): 
  - Monte Carlo simulation techniques for option pricing.
  - Methods for variance estimation to improve the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations.

- [**Monte_Carlo_Variance_Reduction_Importance_Sampling**](./Monte_Carlo_Variance_Reduction_Importance_Sampling): 
  - Techniques for reducing variance in Monte Carlo simulations using importance sampling.
  - Examples demonstrating the effectiveness of variance reduction methods.

- [**Dynamica_Monte_Carlo_and_Stochastics_Volatility_Model**](./Dynamica_Monte_Carlo_and_Stochastics_Volatility_Model): 
  - Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and models incorporating stochastic volatility.
  - Detailed implementations and discussions on stochastic volatility models.
