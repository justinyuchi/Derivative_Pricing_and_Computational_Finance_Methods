# Derivative Pricing and Computational Finance Methods

This repository contains various projects and implementations related to derivative pricing and computational methods. Each folder contains code and documentation for different techniques and models used in the field of quantitative finance.

**Note:** This repository is currently a work in progress, and I am still in the process of uploading and organizing the projects. Please check back regularly for updates.

## Folder Structure

- [**Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_Variance_Estimation**](Monte_Carlo_Simulation_and_Variance_Estimation): 
  - This project demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the expected value of any given expression. 
  - The project also includes variance estimation and visualization.
